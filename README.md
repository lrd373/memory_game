<h2>How To</h2>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to click each image only once, never repeating an image until all 12 images have been clicked.</li>
<li>The challenge is that each time you click a tile, all of the tiles shuffle into a random order.</li>
<li>Once you've clicked an image more than once, game over!</li>
<li>Keep trying to see if you can get your best score to 12.</li>
</ul>
